# SamuLife
Samu (Nahshon) has learnt the rules of Conway's Game of Life. This is 
an example of the paper entitled "Samu in his prenatal development".

This project uses the same COP-based Q-learning engine as [Samu(Nahshon)](https://github.com/nbatfai/nahshon) to predict the next sentences of a conversation.
